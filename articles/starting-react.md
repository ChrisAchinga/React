# Starting A React App With Create-react-app

Details at https://reactjs.org/docs/create-a-new-react-app.html

There are a number of recommended ways of starting a react app.
For starters the create-react-app tool is a great assets. Others are
gatsby, next

As a tutorial, we will build a simple company website using the create-react-app

## Create React App

https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app

https://create-react-app.dev/

1. Starting the Project

Syntax:

```
npx create-react-app {project-name} {--use-npm (to use npm, default is yarn) }
```

Let's give our little project a cute name "DevC20"

So to start the project, start your terminal/cmd and execute the command below:

```shell
npx create-react-app devc20
```

Once the installation is complete, move into the workfolder i.e `cd devc20`. Open the folder using a browser and get ready to type some letters!.

React has a really simple files structure:

Well we need to know that everything is working, so on the current work space, open the terminal and run the local server.

```
yarn start
```

The browser will open and run on localhost:3000

Success!! We just started developing in React.
